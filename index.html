      <h2> Legalization Creates Opportunities for Cannabis Entrepreneurs in New York City</h2>

  <p> It is more than normal to see vendors operating out of trucks on the streets of New York City. They’re mobile and require less money to maintain compared to a storefront. Head to Harlem, on the corner of 116th and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, and you’re greeted with Uncle Budd, a different type of vendor than the others you may be used to.</p>
  <p>The truck isn’t selling produce, coffee, or accessories for Crocs. They’re “gifting” cannabis products. “We don't sell anything. All we do is take donations, and the gifts depend on the size of your donation,” said an employee at the truck in Harlem, who preferred to not give his name at the time.</p>
  <p>
    Uncle Budd is a cannabis business in the city. They currently have 4 trucks located in Midtown, Harlem, NoHo, and East Village. When you look at their website you’ll not only see the different location options, but a full spreadsheet menu for each location, showing what is currently in and out of stock

  <p>With New York State legalizing recreational use in March, there is now a new opportunity for people looking to venture into the world of entrepreneurship. It's also a method for the state to right a history of wrongs.
 </p>
 <p>In New York City, people of color represented 94% of those arrested for cannabis offenses in 2020, according to data compiled from the NYPD and a report by NORML.org, a non-profit advocating for the decriminalization of cannabis. Black people in particular are nearly four times more likely to be arrested than white people for having cannabis, despite Black and white people using it at similar rates, according to the ACLU. </p>
 <p>
    And yet, in 2017 according to Marijuana Business Daily, 81% of marijuana businesses were owned by white people, with only 4% being owned by Black people. As legalization continues to grow across the country, those who come from communities impacted by criminalization are facing barriers preventing them from getting in the space. New York is seeking to remedy that.</p>

 <p>If those who were formerly incarcerated for cannabis offenses decide to participate in the cannabis industry, the Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) according to their website is committed to promoting “social and economic equity applicants who have been harmed by the prohibition of cannabis for adult-use licenses,” with a goal of providing 50% of licenses to applicants who fall under those categories.</p>

 <p> “I’ve been in the penitentiary, so I see it like a dream come true,” said an employee at the Uncle Budd Harlem location. “I probably could make something now where I can have something to leave for my kids.”
